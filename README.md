# Maze Solving Algorithm Visualization

This repository showcases maze-solving algorithms and their visualization techniques. Through Python code, it demonstrates the application of Breadth-First Search (BFS), A* (A-Star), and Q-learning algorithms to find the optimal path through mazes. The code generates maze structures represented as 2D arrays, where 0 indicates free space and 1 represents walls. After plotting the mazes, the algorithms explore them systematically to discover the shortest path from the starting point to the target point.

The Breadth-First Search algorithm explores the maze level by level, ensuring that all reachable cells are visited before moving further away from the starting point. A* algorithm employs a heuristic function to estimate the distance from each cell to the target, guiding the search towards the goal more efficiently. Meanwhile, Q-learning utilizes reinforcement learning principles to learn the optimal path through trial and error, updating a Q-table based on the rewards obtained from each action.

The code visualizes the exploration process of the algorithms, highlighting the cells visited and the final path found. By observing these visualizations, users can gain insights into how each algorithm navigates the maze and selects the optimal path. Additionally, the repository provides an interactive way to understand maze-solving concepts and algorithms through practical implementations.
